# Predicting Youth Unemployment in Africa

This project builds a predictive model to forecast youth unemployment rates in African countries using key socioeconomic indicators. It was developed as a hands-on project during the DSN AI Bootcamp 2025, inspired by a session from Olalekan Akinsande (Mastercard Foundation).

The model uses a synthetic (but realistic) dataset to explore the relationships between GDP per Capita, Education Index, Urban Population (%), and Youth Unemployment Rates.

## Project Workflow and Features

This repository provides a complete end-to-end workflow in a single Jupyter Notebook, including:

* **1. Data Exploration (EDA):** Visualizing the relationships between GDP, education, and unemployment using Matplotlib.
* **2. Model Building:** Training a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn to predict unemployment.
* **3. Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance and interpreting its coefficients to understand feature impact.
* **4. Interactive Prediction:** A simple UI built with `ipywidgets` to simulate predictions for different country profiles by adjusting sliders.

## Results and Performance

The final Linear Regression model demonstrated a clear predictive capability based on the input features.

* **RÂ² Score: 0.74**
    This indicates that the model explains approximately 74% of the variation in youth unemployment rates.
* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1.74**
    This means the model's predictions are, on average, off by 1.74 percentage points.

Visualizations in the notebook also include a Predicted vs. Actual comparison chart.

### Option 2: Run Locally

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Predicting_Youth_Unemployment_in_Africa.git](https://github.com/your-username/Predicting_Youth_Unemployment_in_Africa.git)
    cd Predicting_Youth_Unemployment_in_Africa
    ```

2.  Install dependencies (preferably in a virtual environment):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `.ipynb` file.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    *Note: You may be prompted to upload the CSV file if running locally.*

## Next Steps

Future improvements for this project include:

* **Feature Engineering:** Adding new predictors like internet penetration, access to finance, or sectoral data.
* **Model Comparison:** Benchmarking the Linear Regression model against others (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost).
* **Tuning:** Experimenting with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
